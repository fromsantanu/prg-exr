### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Vehicle Inheritance Hierarchy with Public & Private Modifiers**

Base class `Vehicle` with private attributes: `registrationNumber`, `ownerName`.

* Subclass `Car` with attributes: `make`, `model`, `year`.
* Implement method overriding to display full vehicle details.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Inner Class Example ‚Äì Outer Calculator with Inner Operations**

Create a class `Calculator` with an inner class `Operation` that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

* Accept numbers in the outer class, and let the inner class perform the operations.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Static Members and Static Block Example**

Class `Product` with static variable `totalProducts` and instance variables: `productName`, `price`.

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ **Constructor Overloading Example with Scope Handling**

Create a class `Rectangle` with overloaded constructors:

* Default constructor setting length = 1, breadth = 1.
* Parameterized constructor setting given dimensions.
* Constructor with only length sets a square.
* Include area and perimeter methods.

---

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ **Overloaded Methods with Different Access Specifiers**

Create a class `Calculator`:

* Public method `add(int, int)`
* Private method `add(double, double)`
* Protected method `add(int, int, int)`
* Show method overloading with varying access levels.

---

### üîü **Encapsulation with Validation Logic**

Class `User` with private attributes: `username`, `password`.

* Password must have at least 8 characters, 1 uppercase, 1 digit.
* Write setter with validation.
* Method to display masked username.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ **Abstract Class with Concrete and Abstract Methods**

Abstract class `Shape` with attributes `color`, abstract method `area()`.
Concrete class `Circle` and `Rectangle` extend `Shape`.
Implement `area()` and display shape details.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ **Package Access and Class Scope Example**

Create a package `mypackage` with a class `Employee`.

* Show how classes from outside the package access members based on access modifiers.
* Implement main class in another package.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ **Class with Constant Fields using Final Keyword**

Create a class `PhysicsConstants` with `final` variables like `G`, `PI`, `SPEED_OF_LIGHT`.

* Allow users to access constants via getter methods.
* Use static final fields.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ **Immutable Class Creation (with Private Constructor)**

Create a class `ImmutablePoint` with `x` and `y` attributes.

* No setters, only getters.
* Values assigned via constructor.
* Make class immutable.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ **Encapsulated Bank Locker Access System**

Class `Locker` with private attributes: `lockerNumber`, `password`.

* Provide method `accessLocker(String password)` that allows access only if the password matches.
* Use encapsulation and validation.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ **Use of Final Methods to Prevent Overriding**

Create a class `Account` with a `final` method `showAccountDetails()`.

* Try overriding it in a subclass `SavingsAccount` and explain why it fails.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ **Static Nested Class Example**

Outer class `University` with static nested class `Department`.

* Department holds information about department name, HOD.
* University holds university name and location.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£ **Anonymous Inner Class for Event Handling Simulation**

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Hiding and Controlled Access with Encapsulation**

Class `SecureVault` with a private integer `vaultCode`.

* Allow access only if the user enters a valid admin password through a method `openVault(String password)`.
