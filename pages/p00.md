### 1️⃣ **Swap Two Numbers (Using a Temporary Variable)**

**Problem:**
Accept two numbers and exchange (swap) their contents.

**Approach:**

* Accept two numbers `a` and `b`.
* Use a temporary variable `temp`:

  * `temp = a`
  * `a = b`
  * `b = temp`
* Now `a` and `b` have swapped values.

**Optional (Advanced):** Swap without a temporary variable using arithmetic (`a = a + b; b = a - b; a = a - b;`)

### 2️⃣ **Check if Two Numbers are Positive, Negative, or Zero**

**Problem:**
Accept two numbers and check each one whether it is **positive**, **negative**, or **zero**.

**Approach:**

* Accept two numbers.
* For each number:

  * If number > 0 → Positive
  * Else if number < 0 → Negative
  * Else → Zero

### 3️⃣ **Find the Largest of Two Numbers**

**Problem:**
Accept two numbers and print the largest one.

**Approach:**

* Accept two numbers `a` and `b`.
* Use `if-else` statements:

  * If `a > b` → `a` is largest.
  * Else if `b > a` → `b` is largest.
  * Else → They are equal.

### 4️⃣ **Find the Largest of Three Numbers**

**Problem:**
Accept three numbers and find the largest among them.

**Approach:**

* Accept three numbers `a`, `b`, `c`.
* Use nested `if-else`:

  * If `a > b` and `a > c` → `a` is largest.
  * Else if `b > c` → `b` is largest.
  * Else → `c` is largest.

### 6️⃣ **Grading Based on Average Percentage (Simple Grading)**

**Problem:**
Accept marks of three subjects and calculate the average percentage. Assign grades based on percentage.

**Example Grading Logic:**

* > \= 90% → Grade A
* > \= 75% → Grade B
* > \= 50% → Grade C
* < 50% → Fail

**Approach:**

* Accept three subject marks.
* Calculate total and average.
* Use `if-else` to assign grades based on average percentage.

---

### 7️⃣ **Grading with Pass Condition in Each Subject**

**Problem:**
Accept marks of three subjects.

* A student must pass in **all subjects** (say, passing marks = 35).
* Only then calculate the average and assign grades like in Problem 6.
* If failed in any subject → Declare as **Fail**.

**Approach:**

* Accept three subject marks.
* Check if all marks >= passing mark (35).
* If yes, calculate average and assign grade as in Problem 6.
* Else, print **Fail**.

### 8️⃣ **Employee Perks and Deductions Based on Grade**

**Problem:**
Calculate salary breakdown of employees where:

* Employees are categorized into **Grades A, B, C**.
* Each grade has a different basic salary.
* Perks and deductions depend on grade:

  * **HRA, DA, PF, Tax** percentages vary per grade.

**Approach:**

* Accept employee grade.
* Set basic salary and percentages based on grade.
* Calculate:

  * HRA = % of basic
  * DA = % of basic
  * PF = % of basic
  * Tax = % of gross salary
* Net Salary = Basic + HRA + DA − PF − Tax

### 9️⃣ **Shop Discount and Offers Based on Purchase Amount**

**Problem:**
Calculate final amount after applying discounts/offers:

* Example Offer Logic:

  * If amount > ₹5000 → 20% discount
  * If amount > ₹2000 → 10% discount
  * Else → No discount

**Approach:**

* Accept total purchase amount.
* Use `if-else` ladder to apply correct discount percentage.
* Calculate net payable = total amount − discount.

---

### 🔟 **GST Calculation on Products in a Shop**

**Problem:**
For each product:

* Calculate GST based on price and GST rate.
* Total bill = Sum of price + GST for all products.

**Approach:**

* Accept price and GST rate for each product.
* Calculate GST amount = (Price × GST%) / 100.
* Net price of product = Price + GST.
* Repeat for all products and calculate total payable.
