# **String Handling Special 01 - Programming Exercises**

### 1️⃣ **Arrange the letters in a string (Alphabetical Order)**

**Problem:**
Write a Java program that takes a word (string) as input and arranges its letters in alphabetical order.

**Example:**
Input: `"planet"`
Output: `"aelnpt"`

**Approach:**

* Read the input string.
* Convert the string to a character array.
* Use `Arrays.sort()` to sort the character array.
* Convert the sorted array back to a string and print it.

---

### 2️⃣ **Check if two strings are anagrams**

**Problem:**
Write a Java program to check if two input strings are anagrams of each other (contain the same characters in different orders).

**Example:**
Input: `"listen"`, `"silent"`
Output: `Yes, they are anagrams.`

**Approach:**

* Take two input strings.
* Remove spaces and convert to lowercase (if needed).
* Convert both strings to character arrays.
* Sort both arrays using `Arrays.sort()`.
* Compare the sorted arrays using `Arrays.equals()`.

---

### 3️⃣ **Print all possible anagrams of a word (Permutations)**

**Problem:**
Write a Java program to generate and print all possible anagrams (permutations) of a given word.

**Example:**
Input: `"abc"`
Output:

```
abc  
acb  
bac  
bca  
cab  
cba  
```

**Approach:**

* Use recursion and backtracking:

  * Swap characters at different positions.
  * Recurse for the remaining substring.
  * Backtrack by swapping the characters back after recursion.
* Base condition: If the current position is at the end of the string, print it.

### 4️⃣ **Convert a word to its Pig Latin equivalent**

**Problem:**
Write a Java program that converts a word to Pig Latin.
**Pig Latin Rule:**

* If the word starts with a vowel, add `"way"` to the end.
* If the word starts with a consonant, move all consonants before the first vowel to the end and add `"ay"`.

**Example:**
Input: `"hello"`
Output: `"ellohay"`

Input: `"apple"`
Output: `"appleway"`

**Approach:**

* Check if the first character is a vowel (`a, e, i, o, u`).
* If vowel, append `"way"`.
* If consonant, find the first vowel’s position, move consonants before it to the end, append `"ay"`.

---

### 6️⃣ **Reverse letters in each word of a sentence, keep word order unchanged**

**Problem:**
Write a Java program that reverses each word in a sentence individually while keeping the word sequence in its original order.

**Example:**
Input: `"Java is fun"`
Output: `"avaJ si nuf"`

**Approach:**

* Split the sentence into words using `split(" ")`.
* Reverse each word using a loop or `StringBuilder.reverse()`.
* Join the reversed words with a space separator and print.

---

### 7️⃣ **Use a special logic to encode a message (Custom Cipher)**

**Problem:**
Write a Java program that encodes a message using a special logic:

* Shift each character by **3 positions forward** in ASCII (Caesar Cipher).
* For example, `'a'` becomes `'d'`, `'z'` becomes `'c'`.
* Handle wrap-around for alphabets.

**Example:**
Input: `"abc xyz"`
Output: `"def abc"`

**Approach:**

* Read the input message.
* Loop through each character:

  * If it’s a lowercase letter, shift and wrap using `(char)((ch - 'a' + 3) % 26 + 'a')`.
  * If it’s an uppercase letter, apply similar logic with `'A'`.
  * Leave other characters unchanged.
* Concatenate and print the encoded message.
