| Next ₹3,00,000          | 20%      |
| Income above ₹10,00,000 | 30%      |

* The program should:

  * Take input of **annual income** (must be ≥ 0).
  * Calculate the income tax according to the above slabs.
  * Display:

    * Tax on each slab
    * Total tax payable
  * If income is negative, display `"Invalid income entered."`

* **Example:**

  * If Income = ₹12,00,000

    * First 5,00,000 → ₹0
    * Next 2,00,000 → ₹20,000 (10%)
    * Next 3,00,000 → ₹60,000 (20%)
    * Remaining 2,00,000 → ₹60,000 (30%)
