# **More Programs on Loop - Programming Exercises**

### 1️⃣ **Repeated Addition to Find Product of Two Integers**

**Problem:**
Write a program that multiplies two positive integers using repeated addition instead of using the `*` operator.

**Example:**
Input: `4`, `3`
Output: `12`

**Approach:**

* Take two integer inputs `a` and `b`.
* Initialize a `sum = 0`.
* Use a loop to add `a` to `sum`, `b` times.
* After the loop ends, `sum` will hold the product.

### 2️⃣ **Repeated Subtraction to Find Quotient and Remainder**

**Problem:**
Write a program that divides two positive integers using repeated subtraction. The quotient is the number of times the divisor can be subtracted from the dividend before the dividend becomes less than the divisor. The remaining value is the remainder.

**Example:**
Input: `17`, `5`
Output: `Quotient = 3`, `Remainder = 2`

**Approach:**

* Take two integer inputs `dividend` and `divisor`.
* Initialize `quotient = 0`.
* While `dividend >= divisor`:

  * Subtract `divisor` from `dividend`.
  * Increment `quotient` by 1.
* After the loop, `dividend` is the remainder.

### 3️⃣ **Check if a Number is a Magic Number**

**Problem:**
A number is a **magic number** if the recursive sum of its digits reduces to **1**.
(Keep adding digits until you get a single-digit number. If it is `1`, it is a magic number.)

**Example:**
Input: `1729` → `1+7+2+9 = 19` → `1+9 = 10` → `1+0 = 1`
Output: `Magic Number`

**Approach:**

* Take a number `n`.
* Repeat the following until `n` becomes a single-digit number:

  * Find the sum of digits of `n`.
  * Assign the sum back to `n`.
* After loop ends, check if `n == 1`.

### 4️⃣ **Find All Magic Numbers Between `n` and `m`**

**Problem:**
Print all magic numbers in a given range from `n` to `m` (inclusive).

**Approach:**

* Loop from `n` to `m`.
* For each number, apply the logic used in **Problem 3** to check if it is a magic number.
* If yes, print the number.

### 6️⃣ **Check if a Number is a Disarium Number**

**Problem:**
A number is called a **Disarium number** if the sum of its digits powered with their respective positions equals the number itself.

**Example:**
`135` → `1¹ + 3² + 5³ = 1 + 9 + 125 = 135`
So, `135` is a Disarium number.

**Approach:**

* Convert the number to a string to access each digit with its position.
* Loop through each digit:

  * Raise the digit to the power of its position (starting from 1).
  * Add the result to the sum.
* After loop, check if the sum equals the original number.

### 7️⃣ **Find All Disarium Numbers Between `n` and `m`**

**Problem:**
Print all Disarium numbers between `n` and `m`.

**Approach:**

* Loop through numbers from `n` to `m`.
* For each number, apply the logic from **Problem 6**.
* If a number is Disarium, print it.
