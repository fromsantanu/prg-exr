## 1️⃣ **Eligibility for Choosing ISC Stream Based on ICSE Marks**

### Problem Statement:

Write a program to determine the eligibility of a student to choose a particular stream in ISC based on their ICSE marks in **Mathematics, Science, and English**. The eligibility criteria are as follows:

| Stream          | Criteria                                     |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Science**     | Maths ≥ 80 AND Science ≥ 80 AND English ≥ 65 |
| **Bio Science** | Science ≥ 80 AND English ≥ 65                |
| **Commerce**    | Maths ≥ 60 AND English ≥ 60                  |
| **Humanities**  | English ≥ 50                                 |

* The program should:

  * Take input of marks in **Mathematics, Science, and English**.
  * Check the eligibility for each stream and display all the eligible options.
  * If the student is not eligible for any stream, display `"Not eligible for any stream."`
  * Validate that the entered marks are between 0 and 100. If not, show `"Invalid marks entered."`

## 2️⃣ **Electricity Bill Calculation Based on Connection Type and Units Consumed**

### Problem Statement:

Write a program to calculate the total electricity bill amount for a customer based on:

* **Units Consumed**
* **Type of Connection:**

  * **D** – Domestic
  * **C** – Commercial
  * **I** – Industrial

#### The tariff rates are as follows:

| Connection Type    | Up to 100 Units | 101 - 300 Units | Above 300 Units |
| ------------------ | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| **Domestic (D)**   | ₹2 per unit     | ₹3.5 per unit   | ₹5 per unit     |
| **Commercial (C)** | ₹5 per unit     | ₹7 per unit     | ₹10 per unit    |
| **Industrial (I)** | ₹7 per unit     | ₹10 per unit    | ₹15 per unit    |

* The program should:

  * Input the **Type of Connection (D/C/I)** and **Units Consumed**.
  * Validate the input type and units.
  * Apply the slab-wise rate and calculate the total bill.
  * Example for slab-wise:

    * If Domestic and 350 units are used:

      * First 100 units @ ₹2 = ₹200
      * Next 200 units @ ₹3.5 = ₹700
      * Remaining 50 units @ ₹5 = ₹250
      * **Total = ₹1150**
  * Display the final bill amount with proper labeling.
  * If invalid type or negative units are entered, display `"Invalid input."`
